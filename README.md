# Dev Journal

Have you ever found it difficult keeping track of your daily tasks as a developer or wanting to write a thought down but don't know where to put it? Well, the Dev Journal is perfect for you.

With the Dev Journal, you can keep track of all of your tasks and thoughts in a calendar format. You can even create labels to keep track of tasks that related to each other.We also allow you to upload photos and files so that you can keep all thing related to your developer life in one place.

We wanted to create an app that would be useful for a developer and something that we could see ourselves using.

### How to Install/Launch

To install the app you first want to go here [Install](https://github.com/cse110-sp24-group7/cse110-sp24-group7/releases/tag/v0.1.0)

After you go to this page, you will want to install the .zip file that says Akatsuki.7.

You will then go to your downloads folder and open the .zip.![Download Folder!](/admin/photos/ReadME/Download.png)

Double click on the setup and a option to extract folders will pop up. ![Extract!](/admin/photos/ReadME/Extract.png)

Once you click on "Extract all" then you will be given an option to place a folder in a path of your choice. ![Folder Path!](/admin/photos/ReadME/FolderSelect.png)

You will know have the folder saved in that location and can access it by going to the path it's stored in. ![Destination!](/admin/photos/ReadME/Destination.png)

You can now run the app by double clicking it.

If you are on Windows, you might encounter a screen that looks like this. ![Info!](/admin/photos/ReadME/Info.png)

To run the app, you will have to click on the "More info" button and then you will get the option to run the app through a button that says "Run anyway". ![Run!](/admin/photos/ReadME/Run.png)

Once you've successfuly launched the app, you should get a screen like this. ![Open!](/admin/photos/ReadME/Open.png)

### How to Use

#### Add Task/Journal

To create a task, you can click the "Add Task" button. <br>![AddTask!](/admin/photos/ReadME/AddTask.png)

You can then fill out the fields necessary which are the title, due date, expected time and priority. The labels and description are not required when creating a task. ![TaskPopup!](/admin/photos/ReadME/TaskPopup.png)

To fill out the date, select a day from the calendar and a time as well.![Date!](/admin/photos/ReadME/Date.png)

The priority can be selected and has a range from 0 to 4 where 0 is the most urgent and 4 is the least urgent.![Prio!](/admin/photos/ReadME/Prio.png)

If you want to add a label, you can hover over label, click the create label, type a label and press enter to add it. If you already have a label you, you can select the plus next to the label. You can also remove labels by clicking the x next to them which can be seen in the complete example of the task popup. ![Labels!](/admin/photos/ReadME/Label.png)

After you have done everythin you want, you can click done to save the task or canceling your creation by clicking the red x on the top right of the popup. ![FinTask!](/admin/photos/ReadME/FinTask.png)

Creating a journal has very similar steps. The difference is that the journal has no expected time or priority. The journal also require you to have a description for it unlike the task. ![JournalPopup!](/admin/photos/ReadME/JournalPopup.png) 

#### Edit/Delete

The edit and delete button are pretty self explanatory. The edit opens up the selected task/journal in the popup view and allows you to make changes. The delete allows you to delete a task/journal by double clicking on it. <br> ![Edit&Delete!](/admin/photos/ReadME/Edit.png) 

#### All Task View

The all task view is also self explanatory as it allows you to look at all of your tasks. You can sear a specific task in the search bar at the top left. You can also filter out task through labels and priorities in the top right. ![All Task!](/admin/photos/ReadME/AllTask.png) 

#### Vault

The vault is where you can store files. Images, such as screenshots, will have a preview of what the image looks like. Other files such as pdf or txt files will have a generic icon for them. The vault has a search tool in the top right and a way to add files onm the top left. You can also filter by file types using the scrollable filter to the right of the search tool.![Vault!](/admin/photos/ReadME/Vault.png)
