## Stakeholder Feedback for Product
### Date: 06-06-2024
Stakeholder whose feedback was received: Professor Powell
Key points addressed in feedback session:
- **Feedback**: App currently looks a little empty, not best utilization of space. 
  - **Solution Proposed**: This can be improved by making better use of all the white space on the different pages in our app (for example, on the calendar view). To accomplish this, we should conduct some more research into products that are already out there and how the user interface looks cleaner due to a minimalistic yet complete utilization of space. 
  - **Decision Reached**: We are working to address this highly useful feedback; for instance, we have added the "time left" feature on the all tasks view as a visual indicator of how close the developer is to their deadline. Additionally, we have changed the layout of the all tasks view to make much better use of the space we have.
- **Feedback**: Add Task and Journal buttons seem redundant, only one can be used.
  - **Solution Proposed**: Combine the Add Task and Add Journal into a single "Add Item" button that opens up a menu/dropdown. This would allow the user to pick which one to add and involves less wastage of space on the calendar view. 
  - **Decision Reached**: We put a lot of thought into making these buttons separate. Our thought process was guided by the fact that we want tasks and journals to appear in separate subsections of each day on the weekly view, and a single button had no perfect spot in the UI we envisioned. Rather, separate buttons accomplish this much better. While we agree that the two buttons side by side looks redundant on an empty date, we also keep in mind that most developers using this product will not have many empty days on their calendars, and we decided to prioritize the more common use case. Further, a core tenet in our original problem statement was that a user should be able to accomplish anything on the page within the fewest number of clicks possible. This solution would increase the number of clicks a user needs to make for not enough tradeoff. 
- **Feedback**: On the all tasks view, the search bar is too small and the font for the dates is mismatched with the other fonts on the page.
  - **Solution Proposed**: The search bar on the all tasks view should be larger, covering the entire top section. The font for the dates should be made proper as well. 
  - **Decision Reached**: We can increase the search bar size to cover a much more significant part of the top section of the page, however, we need to leave enough space for the filters for labels and priorities in this section as well. Additionally, we have aligned the fonts and drastically improved the styling and layout of the all tasks view. 
- **Feedback**: In the vault, code snippets can be better formatted to appeal to developers better. 
  - **Solution Proposed**: We could implement functionalities for code highlighting and code-like previews in the code snippets stored in the vault. 
  - **Decision Reached**: While this is highly useful feedback, we have decided not to go forward with it in our product given the short time frame we have left. We are prioritizing bug fixing and improving the quality of our code and product as much as possible, and implementing items that were already on the backlog. Given the fact that this is a largely quality-of-life feature, we have tabled it for further discussion should more time for development open up.
