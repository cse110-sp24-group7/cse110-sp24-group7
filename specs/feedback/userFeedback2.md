Key points addressed in feedback session:

-   **Feedback**: The app is a little slow to load, especially on the first load.
    -   **Solution Proposed**: We can look into optimizing the loading time of the app, as this is a crucial aspect of user experience.
    -   **Decision Reached**: We have already been working on this, but the deadline is too close to make significant changes.
-   **Feedback**: The calendar view is a little empty.
    -   **Solution Proposed**: We can look into adding more features to the calendar view, such as a "time left" feature that shows how close the developer is to their deadline. Or make the spacing more efficient
-   **Remark**: likes the Squares on the All Tasks view and the icons for the timeline
-   **Feedback**: Images for vault extension looks weird
    -   **Solution Proposed**: We can look into improving the styling of the images in the vault extension
