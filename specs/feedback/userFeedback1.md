Key points addressed in feedback session:
- **Feedback**: Plus sign to add labels is not intuitive and difficult to click.
  - **Solution Proposed**: This can be improved by making the entire label option clickable to append existing labels. This way, if the plus sign is not at first obvious to the user they can still simply add them by clicking on the label
  - **Decision Reached**: We will discuss making the entire label option clickable, as that would likely be a relatively simple but useful change. 
- **Feedback**: lack of autocorrect/spell check feature
  - **Solution Proposed**: Add autocorrect or spell check similar to something similar of that of google docs or an iPhone. However, since this will be used for developers, it would be important to have relevant lingo, and syntax accepted. 
  - **Decision Reached**: Though this is an interesting note of feedback that we had not yet considered, given the time constraints and resources we have for the product, this is not feasible change at this time. 
- **Feedback**: Navigation of the calendar is not clear at first glace
  - **Solution Proposed**: A proposed solution for this was to have an increasingly obvious button to navigate through the calendar.
  - **Decision Reached**: We took significant consideration into the design of our project after given feedback on out warmup exercise. In the warmup we went too far with styling and it became highly overdone. In this instance we were aiming for a simple, minimalistic view. Because of this, we will likely keep the current implementation of the calendar navigation. Test subject did acknowledge that once it is found it is simple and easy to use.
- **Feedback**: Task buildup in the all tasks page.
  - **Solution Proposed**: A feature where you can mark tasks as completed.
  - **Decision Reached**: While this is highly useful feedback, we have decided not to go forward with it in our product given the short time frame we have left. We are prioritizing bug fixing and improving the quality of our code and product as much as possible, and implementing items that were already on the backlog. Given the fact that this is a largely quality-of-life feature, we have tabled it for further discussion should more time for development open up. 
- **Feedback**: Likes the all tasks page and the timeline portion. Slight confusion on what the dots represent.
  - **Solution Proposed**: N/A
  - **Decision Reached**: N/A
