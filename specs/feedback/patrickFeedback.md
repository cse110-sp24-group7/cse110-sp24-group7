Key points addressed in feedback session:
- **Feedback**: Due date should auto populate with the day that selected. Otherwise, there is no reason to have add buttons on every day
  - **Solution Proposed**: Auto fill the due date with the date that the "add ___" button is selected. Otherwise, just have one set of buttons.
  - **Decision Reached**: This should be high priority as it is s common dislike among users. 
- **Feedback**: Priority isnt very intuitive.
  - **Solution Proposed**: Use high, medium, low instead of P0, P1, ...
  - **Decision Reached**: This is an easy change that will be discussed with the dev/design team
- **Feedback**: I dont always know how long a task is going to take.
  - **Solution Proposed**: Make the expected time optional.
  - **Decision Reached**: Simple change that will be proposed to the team.
- **Feedback**: When the expected time populates to mainview, it should display "2 hours" instead of just "2". Also, time less than an hour should be converted to minutes.
  - **Solution Proposed**: Add "hours" after the time and check if the time is less than 1 hour. If so, convert to minutes.
  - **Decision Reached**: Minor details which would be nice to include but not necessary given the time constraint.
- **Feedback**: How can i see all of my journals?
  - **Solution Proposed**: Have an all journals page similar to all tasks or include journals on the all tasks page and have a filter.
  - **Decision Reached**: Given the remaining time, this is not feasible but certainly a good point for future developement.
- **Feedback**: Poor font choice, needs more color
- **Feedback**: Liked the vault a lot
