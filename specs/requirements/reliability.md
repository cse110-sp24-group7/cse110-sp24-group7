# Reliability

## Definition

Our team defines reliability as the ability of our application to perform consistently and predictably. We want to make sure that our application is reliable and that it can be used without any issues. As such, we have made sure that our application is robust and that it can handle any errors that may occur. We have also made sure that our application is secure and that it can be used without any issues.

## Target

Our goal for reliability is for our application to be able to handle any errors that may occur during regular use. We want to make sure that our application is secure and that it can be used without any issues. We have made sure that our application is robust and that it can handle any errors that may occur.

Key Tenet: **Extensive Unit and E2E Testing**

## Testing

We used multiple libraries to test our application, including Jest, Puppeteer, and Playwright. Initially, we conducted an extensive testing suite for our backend SQLite3 Database and other static components when we initially hosted our app on a website rather than a PWA with Electron. This enabled us to conduct unit tests on our backend and frontend components, as well as end-to-end tests for each component and interleaving components/pages. **Since our app does not rely on the network**, we don't have to worry about network errors, caching, or other network-related issues. As as result, we were able to focus on testing the reliability of our app in terms of its ability to handle errors and other issues that may occur during regular use.
