# Usability

## Definition

Our team defines usability as the ease of use and learnability of our application. We want to make sure that our application is easy to use for all users, regardless of their technical background. As such, we have no complicated design mechanisms, our navigation is quite simple by clicking on the sidebar buttons and every button/feature is labeled and easy to understand. 

## User Interface

As we mentioned in our *design* process and in our User Stories, we wanted to create a simple and intuitive interface that would be easy to use for all users. Thus, while installing the app might be a bit cumbersome, the actual usage of the app should be as simple as possible. Our goal was to create an app that would take no more than 6 clicks to get to any feature. We believe that we have achieved this goal, as well as the UI is very easy to the eye and the user can clearly navigate through the app.


## Target

Our target audience is developers who are looking for a simple and easy-to-use journaling app. The minimal interface and only having a couple, high quality pages and features contributes to the usability of the app. We've restricted I/O on the all-tasks page to only display the most important information, have the dashboard take care of actually inputting and creating tasks, and have the calendar page be a simple, easy-to-use calendar. We've also made some Quality of Life Changes like having the menu bar slide out and having a Today Button to navigate to the current day. Likewise, also having the All-Tasks exhibit a 10-point scale for each task and having a simple scrollable list of tasks and files. 

Key Tenet: **We wanted unambiguous features, so a user will never get confused while using our app. We wanted to make sure that the user can easily navigate through the app and find what they are looking for as well as what data they want to input**. 

## Testing

To test our usability, we conducted "Dogfooding" where we used the app ourselves in topical use-cases to see if the app was easy and intuitive to use. As it supplemented the work we were doing in CSE 110, we were able to see if the app matched up with user behaviors. We also had friends of ours who were computationally oriented to use our app, as they would not have the *developer bias* that we would have. 

With the feedback we got, we modified the placement of our search queries and filters, the format of how we displayed labels on a task-popup/journal-popup and the overall layout/display of the vault.
