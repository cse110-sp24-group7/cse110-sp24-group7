# Calendar View V2

## Purpose
This is the calendar view of the Akatsuki 7 Developer Journal. The main page is meant to be a week view with a "Tasks" and "Journal" section for each column. Each column displays a different day of the week that shows the user's tasks and journal entries they have filled out for that day. There will also be a sidebar that pops out when the menu button with three lines is clicked.

## Features
**Three Lines Button**
This button serves as a "Menu" button that takes the user to a different page of the app. So far, this button will give the user the option to go to the vault page.

**Sidebar**
This is the bar that will pop out and block part of the week view when the menu button with three lines is clicked. This contains the links to the Due Today, All Tasks, Photo Vault, Code Vault, Search, and Filter pages which will allow the user to specify what task and journal entries they want to see.

**Dotted Add Button**
This button serves as a way for the user to add a new task or journal entry. This was cleaner than the previous method of putting an add button to each label of Task or Journal.

**Task Boxes and Journal Boxes**
Each box is a preview of the user's task or journal entry. When clicked, it pops out the full entry.
