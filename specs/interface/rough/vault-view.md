# Vault View

## Purpose
This is the vault view of the Akatsuki 7 Developer Journal. Here, each files and images can be saved as a type of quick access for the user to refer to. If a file or image is clicked, the user will be directed to their local storage where the file is actually stored. In essence, these are quick access shortcuts.

## Features
**Search Bar**
The user can search for specific words that are in the file names or even in the files. 

**Filter Bar**
The user can filter by file type or even date accessed.
