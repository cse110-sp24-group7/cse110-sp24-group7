# Calendar View V1

## Purpose
This is the calendar view of the Akatsuki 7 Developer Journal. The main page is meant to be a week view with a "Tasks" and "Journal" section for each column. Each column displays a different day of the week that shows the user's tasks and journal entries they have filled out for that day. There will also be a sidebar that includes the task list for the current day.

## Features
**"+" Button:** 
Within each Journal and Task section in each day, there is a green "+" button attached to each Task and Journal header block. By clicking the button, it sends the user to a pop up where they can input a new entry, which will save a new entry in the main view.

**Sidebar** 
On the right side of the view, there will be a sidebar that displays the tasks for the user on the current day, as well as a way for them to mark a task as complete.

**Task Boxes and Journal Boxes**
Each box is a preview of the user's task or journal entry. When clicked, it pops out the full entry.
