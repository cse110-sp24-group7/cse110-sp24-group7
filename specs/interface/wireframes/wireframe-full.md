# Wireframe for Full View

## Purpose

This is the complete view of our wireframe for the Akatsuki 7 Developer Journal. Although it is a bit hard to read each page, it shows the general flow of how each page is meant to be viewed and from where. Our wireframes show the inclusion of a weekly calendar page (labeled home page) and a vault page that stores the user's files and images.

-   The big black arrows show paths to different pages
-   The thin long red arrows show paths from the buttons on the calendar page to reveal the popup, and the buttons on the popup to travel back to the main calendar page.

## Features

**Calendar Page:**
The main page of the app. Shows a full 7-day week calendar view that shows previews of the "tasks" and "journal entries" of the user for each day. Each column (day of the week) has a green "+" button within the Journal Section that, when clicked, shows a popup where the user can input a new journal entry for their day (labeled journal popup). Similarly, there is a green "+" button within the Task Section that shows a popup screen where the user can input a new task in the same way.

**Three Lines Menu Button:**
In the top right corner of the home page, there are three lines indicating a menu button where the user can choose to leave the home page and enter the vault. The Black arrow indicates a page change when the button is clicked, sending the user to the vault page

**Vault Page:**
The Vault page serves as an all-in-one vault for the user's images and files that they may have included in their journal entries. It serves to be an easy way to grab images and files from previous days without having to scroll through the calendar. It can be filtered to search by files or images. There is also a search bar to search for the file/image's title.
