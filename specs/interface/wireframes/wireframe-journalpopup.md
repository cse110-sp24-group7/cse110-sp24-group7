# Wireframe for Journal Popup

## Purpose
This is the journal popup that is displayed when the user chooses to add a new journal entry by clicking the green "+" button on the main calendar view page (labeled as home page on the image). The features of this popup includes the Date, Title, and Description fields, enabling users to document their thoughts and experiences efficiently. 

## Features
**Sentiment Widget:** 
On the bottom is also our Sentiment Widget app from the warmup as an optional field in a Journal to reflect on the day. We can use this to aggregate statistics about positivity and the sentiment of a user over a given sprint.

**Red "X" Button:** 
If the user wants to discard their journal entry, this red button will send the user back to the initial calendar page that they came from without adding any new journal entry.

**Green "Done" Button:** 
When the user is done with their journal entry, this green button will send the user back to the initial calendar page that they came from while also adding a new journal entry to the column of the day of the week they chose to add the new entry from.
