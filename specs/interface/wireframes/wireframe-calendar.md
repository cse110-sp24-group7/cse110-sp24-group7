# Wireframe for Calendar View

## Purpose

This is the view of the calendar and popup mechanisms of our wireframe for the Akatsuki 7 Developer Journal. It shows the general flow of how each popup is meant to be triggered and from where.

-   The thin long red arrows show paths from the buttons on the calendar page to reveal the popup, and the buttons on the popup to travel back to the main calendar page.

## Features

**Calendar Page:**
The main page of the app. Shows a full 7-day week calendar view that shows previews of the "tasks" and "journal entries" of the user for each day. Each column (day of the week) has a green "+" button within the Journal Section that, when clicked, shows a popup where the user can input a new journal entry for their day (labeled journal popup). Similarly, there is a green "+" button within the Task Section that shows a popup screen where the user can input a new task in the same way.

**Green "+" Button:**
Within each Journal and Task section in each day, there is a green "+" button where the user can input a new journal entry or task. By clicking the button, it sends the user to a pop up where they can input a new entry, which will save a new entry in the main view.
