# Wireframe for Vault View

## Purpose
This is the view of the vault and filter mechanisms of our wireframe for the Akatsuki 7 Developer Journal. It shows the general flow of how each filter is meant to be triggered and from where. The Vault page serves as an all-in-one vault for the user's images and files that they may have included in their journal entries. It serves to be an easy way to grab images and files from previous days without having to scroll through the calendar. It can be filtered to search by files or images. There is also a search bar to search for the file/image's title.

- The big black arrows show paths to different pages

## Features
**Black "+" Button:** 
The black "+" button allows users to add a new file or image to the vault that is not tied to any specific day. By clicking the button, it asks the user to provide a new file or image, which will be saved within  in the main view.

**File and Image Boxes**
Each box is a preview of the user's added file or image. When clicked, it pops out the full file. It displays the file's name and a preview image of the contents of that file.

**Search bar and Filter Menu**
These fields are meant for the user to search for their desired file or image quicker by using a filter by files or images. There is also a search bar to search for the file/image's title.
