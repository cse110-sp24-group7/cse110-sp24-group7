# Vault View

## Purpose

This is the vault view of the Akatsuki 7 Developer Journal. This secondary page is meant to be a vault view of all the user's images and files. The Vault page serves as an all-in-one vault for the user's images and files that they may have included in their journal entries. It is meant to be an easy way to grab images and files from previous days without having to scroll through the calendar.

## Features

**Black "+" Button:**
The black "+" button allows users to add a new file or image to the vault that is not tied to any specific day. By clicking the button, it asks the user to provide a new file or image, which will be saved within in the main view.

**File and Image Boxes**
Each box is a preview of the user's added file or image. When clicked, it pops out the full file. It displays the file's name and a preview image of the contents of that file.

**Search bar and Filter Menu**
These fields are meant for the user to search for their desired file or image quicker by using a filter by files or images. There is also a search bar to search for the file/image's title.
