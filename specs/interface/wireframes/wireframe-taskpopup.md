# Wireframe for Task Popup

## Purpose

This is the task popup that is displayed when the user chooses to add a new journal entry by clicking the green "+" button on the main calendar view page (labeled as home page on the image). The features of this popup includes essential attributes such as Due Date, Priority, Label, Expected Time, and Description, with markdown support for enhanced formatting.

## Features

**Priority Label**
On the righthand side of the popup displays a priority label box, where the user can choose what level of urgency (priority) their new task will have. This can range from 1-5 on a dropdown menu, where the number closer to 1 indicates a more urgent priority. This will assist in choosing the color and proximity to the top of the page the task preview will be on the main calendar page. This serves to let the user easily distinguish between their important tasks and less urgent tasks in their full weekly calendar view.

**Custom Labels**
These labels are meant to give the user an easy way to distinguish their tasks by a label name that they create. If the user wanted to use multiple labels for the same task, they can add a new label by clicking the green "+" button.

**Red "X" Button:**
If the user wants to discard their journal entry, this red button will send the user back to the initial calendar page that they came from without adding any new journal entry.

**Green "Done" Button:**
When the user is done with their journal entry, this green button will send the user back to the initial calendar page that they came from while also adding a new journal entry to the column of the day of the week they chose to add the new entry from.
