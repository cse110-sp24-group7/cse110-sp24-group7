# Calendar View

## Purpose
This is the calendar view of the Akatsuki 7 Developer Journal. The main page is meant to be a calendar view of the current week with a "Tasks" and "Journal" section. Each column displays a different day of the week that shows the user's tasks and journal entries they have filled out for that day.

## Features
**Green "+" Button:** 
Within each Journal and Task section in each day, there is a green "+" button where the user can input a new journal entry or task. By clicking the button, it sends the user to a pop up where they can input a new entry, which will save a new entry in the main view.

**Task Boxes and Journal Boxes**
Each box is a preview of the user's task or journal entry. When clicked, it pops out the full entry.

**Three Lines Button**
This button serves as a "Menu" button that takes the user to a different page of the app. So far, this button will give the user the option to go to the vault page.
