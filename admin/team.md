## Team Introduction

Welcome to the Akatsuki 7 team page! We are a group of 11 students in CSE 110 Spring '24! Please look forward to our ongoing project and team member Introductions!

### Motivation Behind the Name/Brand

Given our number **Team 7**, we decided to name ourselves after the Akatsuki, a reference from the Anime Show **Naruto**. The Team 7 was derived from the main trio of the group, Naruto, Sakura and Sasuke were all members of Team 7(led by Kakashi). Humorously, we have learned more about Naruto in the last two days than we have in our entire lives. As such, many of the branding elements are Ninja-esque and our main color scheme takes after the _Akatsuki_, a group of rogue ninja in the show that are clad in **red,black and white** robes.

## Team Members

### Team Leads

#### Samvrit Srinath

Hi everyone! My name is Samvrit Srinath, and I am a 2nd year computer science Major! I love to play video games (RPGs), cook a variety of cuisines and go hiking! My favorite shape has to be a Hexagon. I donâ€™t know, thereâ€™s just something so satisfying about looking at Beehives. Iâ€™m looking forward to working in a Team Project and learning about my innate Ninja abilities with the rest of everyone! **Github Page**: <a href="https://samvritsrinath.github.io/CSE110Lab1/">Samvrit's Website</a>

#### Arnav Kamdar

Hey everyone, I'm Arnav Kamdar, a second year computer science major in Muir. Some of my hobbies are wall climbing (you can find me at UCSD's climbing gym every other evening of the week) and hiking! My favorite shape has to be an isosceles triangle because of its balance of symmetry and imperfection - circles and equilateral triangles seem a bit too perfect to me, like they're hiding something. I'm looking forward to getting a much better idea of software engineering (to hopefully help with future internships and jobs) and also to build a strong community with some great budding SEs. **Github Page**: [Arnav's Webpage](https://arnavkamdar.github.io/CSE-110-Lab1/)

### Developers and Designers

#### Jessica Qu - Designer

Hello, my name is Jessica and Iâ€™m a 2nd year Math-CS major living in Warren! My hobbies include playing badminton and cooking, as well as trying new restaurants. My favorite shape is probably a triangle because theyâ€™re so useful and they were pretty fun in Geometry as well. Iâ€™m really looking forward to meeting everyone, working on a project together, and hopefully becoming good friends with yâ€™all!

#### Andrew Yang - Developer

Hi everyone, my name is Andrew Yang, and I am a second year CS major in Warren. I enjoy playing video games, and playing ping pong. As for my favorite shape, I like cylinders because they are the basis for beautiful pillars in many cool architecture. I'm looking forward to working everyone and contribute to the project! **Github Page**: [Andrew Webpage](https://andronius-yang.github.io/cse110lab1/)

#### Deena Penderson - Developer

Hi everyone! My name is Deena Pederson and I am a 4th year Math-CS major in Muir. I compete on the softball team here at UCSD which ends up occupying a significant amount of my free time, but besides that I love going to the beach and cooking. I would say my favorite shape is a triangle for no particular reason. I am looking forward to working as a team and hopefully have some fun while building our project! **Github Page**: [Deena's Webpage](https://deenap23.github.io/PagesProject/)

#### Emma Nguyen - Developer

Hi, my name is Emma Nguyen. I am a 3rd year computer science major. My hobbies are about sports and music. I like playing ping pong and listening to music. My favorite instrument is piano. I don't really have a favorite shape, but I would be more interested in a rectangle. Because it is symmetric but not too perfect, which allows me to arrange them in various ways, and construct an array of diverse shapes from rectangular blocks. I am looking forward to working with our team in CSE110. My **Github Page**: [Emma's Webpage](https://faquanly.github.io/SP24-MyPage/)

Hi everyone, my name is Hashim Fituri and I'm a third year computer engineering major in Sixth. I like to fish, work out, play basketball, and play videogames in my free time. My favorite shape would be a square because I see a lot of squares in my daily life. I'm looking forward to getting a more in depth understanding of SWE and hopefully collaborate together on our project. **Github Page**: [Hashim Webpage](https://hfituri.github.io/CSE110/)
