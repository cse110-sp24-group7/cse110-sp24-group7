Technique: SWOT Analysis
===================================

Strengths
---------
Add notes on the ideas, tools, and positive attributes of the topic.

- Communication (6 votes)
    - I think we were very good with communication and just keeping everyone in the loop
    - Communication; daily check-ins helped and groups were responsive
    - Significant improvement as a team with communication and cohesion. Better time management and overall workflow!
    - Active Daily, and responsive communication from everyone!
    - Responsive and collaborative team - team has high cohesion
    - Communication game has improved significantly. The team as a whole became more comfortable talking about our blockers/concerns
    - Communication between team members
    - Cohesion across different teams

- Collaborative Development/Fast Work (8 votes)
    - Getting work done! It felt like we got more done in the last sprint then the two before. More organized and everyone was more accountable.
    - Really good at collaborative development, excellent at building from feedback. Great development skills from everyone on the team, and much better time management this time around. 
- Team lead and team members are responsible and supportive (1 vote)

Weaknesses
----------
Add notes on the areas or items that need to be made better or are holding you back.

- Bus Factor for Backend (8 votes)
    - Hard to point weaknesses this time around, but we could've had less of a bus factor on the backend maybe - mainly dependent on 2-3 devs
    - Slight Bus Factor on Backend

- Improvement over time (0 votes)
    - It a took a little bit for everyone to become accountable. The check in everyday I think really helped to put pressure on and get everyone working.
    - We may have had a relatively more rockier start but this was significantly improved 
- Personally I think I should clean up my code more often - there's alot of random commented out code that is very distracting if others were to read my code. (1 vote)
- The lack of java scripts and web development experience (0 votes)
- Honestly not much, I think we really improved with being considerate of everyone's schedules (0 votes)
- I think that time was an issue for us but not as much as the first sprint (0 votes)

Opportunities
-------------
Add notes on areas where your team can see future benefits.

- All around development (6 votes)
    - We could spend some time going briefly how new code works to reduce bus factor
    - Maybe we can switch teams around more and switch backend to frontend and so forth if there is enough time
    - For more people to be aware of the project as a whole, more full-stacky issues/roles

- Smooth Workflow (5 votes)
    - we learned how to effectively work together and have a smooth workflow
    - Working together in the future, we could definitely build much better products given the great team dynamic we have right now.
- Our app is modular and supports quick development, as seen with the case of the vault page. (0 votes)
- Project looks good on our resumes (0 votes)

Threats
-------
Add notes on issues that stand in the way of success or the negative ramifications that could occur.

- Bus Factor (4 votes)
    - Not knowing how the entire backend and frontend works as an individual
    - Low bus factor for backend - could hinder future development past this course.

- Inconsistent Dev Workflow (1 vote)
    - It took a bit before we had everyone consistently contributing. I think we would have benefited from daily checkins at the start but overall everything came out great
    - Inconsistent dev cycle
- Having to make a brainrot video for our app to curry favor :( (0 votes)
