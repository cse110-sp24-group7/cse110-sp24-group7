Technique: Wishes, Risks, Appreciations, and Puzzles
===================================

Wishes
------
Add notes about what you wish could happen.

- Integration (7 votes)
    - I wish the integration of the components went smoother 
    - More time for integration
    - I wish that the implementation of our MVP went smoother, we struggled with getting all parts of the integration to work and it is still an issue we need to resolve.

- More Time (7 votes)
    - I wished that we had less delays so that the final hard deadline (today) would be more approachable.
    - Better use of time and understanding of division of labor
    - I wish team progress and management were a bit more streamlined for faster development.

-  (0 votes)
    - I wish that I could have worked faster and ensured less last-minute work
- I had a better understanding of what was going on outside of my own task (4 votes)
- More communication or heads up about upcoming conflicts (1 vote)

Risks
-----
Add notes to highlight potential risks.

- More Communication Needed (17 votes)
    - Lack of communication and proactivity could put us behind in the future.
    - partners disappeared
    - Could be more communication between teams while in progress with respective tasks to prevent conflicts
    - Lack of communication can create staggering work. We should be more open about blockers and what's hindering progress.

- Last Minute Development (11 votes)
    - While functional, we should have started earlier and focused more on our pipeline/design process to ensure smooth development. Hashed out a full E2E javascript app on Electron before fiddling around with our actual app
    - putting everything together/integration more last minute
    - Underestimating time and not starting early led to rushes towards the end while there was a lull of time in the middle
- There are risks of aiming too high in v1 where we don't have a well produced product in time to even implement v2. (1 vote)

Appreciations
-------------
Add notes about ideas, people, processes, or tools, etc. that we can appreciate.

- I appreciate how patient my teammates are with absences and circumstances because I know that it can be a set back. I also appreciate how organized everyone is and how we went about not taking, GitHub issues, etc. (1 vote)
- Andrew for all his work on the backend and integration ðŸ™Œ (0 votes)
- Andrew put in a lot of hard work! Thank you. I wish I knew what was going on with integration and could've helped (2 votes)
- Huge shout out to all the devs who stepped in for each other and for issues that they weren't assigned to, really kept the team going (1 vote)
- Andrew and Matteo for being able to help out with despite being very last minute and rushed (0 votes)
- I appreciate how great we collaborate and work within the team (0 votes)
- I appreciate everyone who was able to help in a pinch even when it wasn't their designated task (0 votes)
