### Purpose of the Sprint Review

Today's Sprint Review was held to go over the first official sprint that our team has had, namely in the formation of the minimum viable product for the final project. We held this review because we were interested in knowing what each team member was proud of personally, as well as to note some important group accomplishments. Being part of a team, it is often easy to forget to commend others on their work and focus on accomplishments, as we get lost in the minutiae and deadlines of the work.
