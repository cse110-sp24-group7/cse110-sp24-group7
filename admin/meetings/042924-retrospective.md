### Purpose of the Retrospective

Today's Retrospective was held to go over the first sprint that our team has had, namely in the creation of a sentiment rating widget. We held this retrospective to gauge sentiment from team members about what went well in the warmup sprint, what could have gone better, and suggestions for future sprints. The retrospective was held over Retrium during our meeting, and each member provided their feedback anonymously. Ultimately, we aimed to better streamline our development process and ensure that all team members feel psychologically safe in the team environment.

### High Points of the Retrospective

Following is feedback that we received on Retrium, segmented into groups as per the meeting and discussed at length in the Retrospective:

-   **Liked:**
    -   Liking the End Product:
        -   I liked that we all pitched in towards the product, working around other commitments and deadlines. I also love the design of the product!
        -   All the moving parts came together to create a viable product
        -   I think the look of the website was way better than expected and there were a lot more features than I expected to be implemented
        -   Integration of all the parts went better than I expected. There were so many branches, folders, and files but it got consolidated into a final piece.
    -   Division Of Labor/Workflow:
        -   People picking up after each other and the teamwork involved in the process
        -   Positive team energy. Everybody contributed and worked together and were responsive on Slack.
        -   The division of labor was clear; there was no confusion about what was expected for a task and we knew what everyone else was working on
        -   Workflow was well organized, got the project done on time with minimal time crunch
        -   I liked how the works were organized and divided among team members
        -   I liked how the team leads organized tasks and how well the team banded together to create the widget.
-   **Learned:**
    -   Github:
        -   Learned GitHub a lot better, as well as a lot about team scheduling and management.
        -   I learned about GitHub Actions and how to use Github Projects to set up Issues, Labels, and Listing on the Cloud
    -   Time Management/Effectively Schedule
        -   Learned how to speedrun during crunchtime, be open with communication and what is lacking, how to read other's code
        -   I learned that we should figure out each other's availabilities more and also make tasks less dependent on each other.
    -   Development - Tools at our Disposal
        -   I learned more about the design aspect and what documentation to include with any pushed changes
        -   How to use ChatGPT to our advantage in case we don't know how to do something and to speed up development
    -   Integrating Different Features/Working with other people + new code
        -   Learnt about integrating different widgets together.
        -   Learned how to interact with and build on other code that I hadn't written.
        -   I learned how the members and leads work as well as some new technical skills
-   **Lacked:**
    -   Workflow
        -   The code could've been more streamlined; unclear what was going to be included in the final product
        -   Lack of Rigorous Styling and Testing, code style and structure was different as well as how the repository was structured.
        -   Parallelization, repo structure
    -   Communication
        -   Communicating and planning progress so that the timeline set out is accomplished
        -   Organizing branches and communicating when we'll be done with tasks.
        -   Only ending times during check-in
        -   I think we didn't lack much just that there could have been better splitting up of tasks based on availability but overall it was still good.
    -   Time Management
        -   Time constraints meant that deadlines were very quick to catch up, so sometimes people had to wait for others' work to be done.
        -   Time and schedules from people who might have been busy
-   **Longed For:**
    -   Time Awareness
        -   Better scheduling around personal commitments, better parallelization for efficiency, good code structure from the beginning.
        -   Better idea on timing if code depended on something else first.
        -   More time awareness
        -   Definitely time, with a weeklong sprint it was difficult to meet strict deadlines
    -   Final Product/Testing
        -   A more clear structure in regards to code to avoid duplicate code and extraneous files
        -   I feel like it would have been nice to know more specifications about the app but it was also nice having total freedom over it
        -   Maybe could use tests for widgets, unsure how that would integrate in the final product but would be nice to automate tests before pull requests.
    -   Miscellaneous
        -   Communication with Leads in case things get delayed :D, also Leads to assign things better for developers so that work is easier.
        -   Having a working gradient animation with no bugs

### Overall Takeaways

Reflecting on the retrospective, it's evident that the team's cohesion and commitment were instrumental in overcoming challenges and delivering a successful product. The feedback provided valuable insights into areas for improvement. These will be invaluable in shaping future sprints and ensuring continued growth of the team's skill sets. Overall, the retrospective served as a valuable opportunity for the team to reflect, setting a good precedent for future projects.

### Action Items Created Based on Feedback

-   Parallelization: Work on Better Parallelization Structure, make sure issues can be assigned in parallel and have deadlines based on Time and make sure to account for hiccups.
-   Prep: More Hi-fidelity Wireframes, work on UX features earlier and then add-ons can be discussed during Weekly Meetings.
-   Structure: Set up Common Code Styling and Structure, make sure there are consistent Pages Folder and Components Folder each with their own stylesheet and .js file, that are imported/exported to pages —> main
-   Testing: Improved testing protocols —> use Jest and have automated jobs before PR, make sure to test all .js components
-   Scheduling: Better scheduling, know each others schedules (midterms, finals, essays, etc.): make sure that announcements for weekly scheduling are there in slack #scheduling channel
