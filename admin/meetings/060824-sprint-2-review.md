### Attendees:

### Purpose of the Sprint Review

Today's Sprint Review was held to go over the second and final official sprint that our team has had, namely in the formation of the final release of the product for our final project. We held this review because we were interested in knowing what each team member was proud of personally, as well as to note some important group accomplishments. Being part of a team, it is often easy to forget to commend others on their work and focus on accomplishments, as we get lost in the minutiae and deadlines of the work.

Specifically, we highlight the team's **cohesion**, with all developers working as a team and picking up after one another. As always, the team's **quick thinking** was highlighted in the limited timeframe. However, one notable improvement from previous sprints is a much stronger emphasis on **clear communication**, **time management**, and **great work distribution**.
