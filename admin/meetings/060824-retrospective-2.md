### Purpose of the Retrospective

Today's Retrospective was held to go over the second and final official sprint that our team has had, namely in the completion of our final product (including better functionalities, styling, and the addition of the all-tasks view and the vault). We held this retrospective to gauge sentiment from team members about what went well in the sprint, what could have gone better, and suggestions for future sprints. The retrospective was held over Retrium during our meeting, and each member provided their feedback anonymously. Ultimately, we aimed to better streamline our development process and ensure that all team members feel psychologically safe in the team environment.

### High Points of the Retrospective

Following is feedback that we received on Retrium, segmented into groups as per the meeting and discussed at length in the Retrospective:

- **Strengths**
  - Communication
    - I think we were very good with communication and just keeping everyone in the loop
    - Communication; daily check-ins helped and groups were responsive
    - Significant improvement as a team with communication and cohesion. Better time management and overall workflow!
    - Active Daily, and responsive communication from everyone!
    - Responsive and collaborative team - team has high cohesion
    - Communication game has improved significantly. The team as a whole became more comfortable talking about our blockers/concerns
    - Communication between team members
    - Cohesion across different teams
  - Collaborative Development/Fast Work
    - Getting work done! It felt like we got more done in the last sprint than the two before. More organized and everyone was more accountable.
    - Really good at collaborative development, excellent at building from feedback. Great development skills from everyone on the team, and much better time management this time around.
  - Miscellaneous
    - Team lead and team members are responsible and supportive
- **Weaknesses:**
  - Bus Factor for Backend
    - Hard to point weaknesses this time around, but we could've had less of a bus factor on the backend maybe - mainly dependent on 2-3 devs
    - Slight Bus Factor on Backend
  - Improvement over time
    - It took a little bit for everyone to become accountable. The check-in every day I think really helped to put pressure on and get everyone working.
    - We may have had a relatively rockier start but this was significantly improved
  - Miscellaneous
    - Personally, I think I should clean up my code more often - there's a lot of random commented-out code that is very distracting if others were to read my code.
    - The lack of JavaScript and web development experience
    - Honestly not much, I think we really improved with being considerate of everyone's schedules
    - I think that time was an issue for us but not as much as the first sprint
- **Opportunities:**
  - All-around development
    - We could spend some time going briefly over how new code works to reduce bus factor
    - Maybe we can switch teams around more and switch backend to frontend and so forth if there is enough time
    - For more people to be aware of the project as a whole, more full-stacky issues/roles
  - Smooth Workflow
    - We learned how to effectively work together and have a smooth workflow
    - Working together in the future, we could definitely build much better products given the great team dynamic we have right now.
  - Miscellaneous:
    - Our app is modular and supports quick development, as seen with the case of the vault page.
    - Project looks good on our resumes
- **Threats:**
  - Bus Factor
    - Not knowing how the entire backend and frontend works as an individual
    - Low bus factor for backend - could hinder future development past this course.
  - Inconsistent Dev Workflow
    - It took a bit before we had everyone consistently contributing. I think we would have benefited from daily check-ins at the start but overall everything came out great
    - Inconsistent dev cycle
  

### Issues voted on, discussion done, and consensus received:
- Collaborative Development/Fast Work:
  - Team excelled at collaboration this time around, with everyone contributing greatly and helping out whenever help was needed, even if it wasn't their responsibility.
  - Daily check-ins helped a lot with better time management
- Bus Factor for Backend:
	- Certain developers were much more backend oriented and handled most of the work done for the backend, leaving other developers in the dark about it. 
	- A rotation would've helped so that everyone could be equally oriented towards using each of the tools.
	- Usage of SQL led to backend being limited behind a knowledge gap, making only a few people viable developers for it within the time frame. 
	- Consensus received was that if we had more time, we could have spent time learning the backend languages and specifics for everyone to become all-around devs.
- Communication: 
  - Much better communication this time, developers were openly transparent due to check-in channel. 

### Overall Takeaways

Reflecting on the retrospective, it's evident that the team's cohesion and time management were instrumental in overcoming challenges and delivering a successful product. The feedback provided valuable insights into how we have improved over the course of the quarter, and how we might improve further. These retrospectives have been invaluable in shaping sprints and ensuring continued growth of the team's skill sets, and this one will hopefully help when we pursue further SE projects in the future. Overall, the retrospective served as a valuable opportunity for the team to reflect, setting a good precedent for future projects.
