### Purpose of the Retrospective

Today's Retrospective was held to go over the first official sprint that our team has had, namely in the formation of an MVP for our final product. We held this retrospective to gauge sentiment from team members about what went well in the sprint, what could have gone better, and suggestions for future sprints. The retrospective was held over Retrium during our meeting, and each member provided their feedback anonymously. Ultimately, we aimed to better streamline our development process and ensure that all team members feel psychologically safe in the team environment.

### High Points of the Retrospective

Following is feedback that we received on Retrium, segmented into groups as per the meeting and discussed at length in the Retrospective:

- **Wishes:**
  - Integration:
    - I wish the integration of the components went smoother
    - More time for integration
    - I wish that the implementation of our MVP went smoother, we struggled with getting all parts of the integration to work and it is still an issue we need to resolve.
  - More Time:
    - I wished that we had less delays so that the final hard deadline (today) would be more approachable.
    - Better use of time and understanding of division of labor.
    - I wish team progress and management were a bit more streamlined for faster development.
  - Miscellaneous:
    - I wish I had a better understanding of what was going on outside of my own task
    - I wish that I could have worked faster and ensured less last-minute work
    - More communication or heads up about upcoming conflicts
- **Risks:**
  - More Communication Needed:
    - Lack of communication and proactivity could put us behind in the future.
    - partners disappeared
    - Could be more communication between teams while in progress with respective tasks to prevent conflicts
    - Lack of communication can create staggering work. We should be more open about blockers and what's hindering progress.
  - Last Minute Development
    - While functional, we should have started earlier and focused more on our pipeline/design process to ensure smooth development. Hashed out a full E2E javascript app on Electron before fiddling around with our actual app
    - putting everything together/integration more last minute
    - Underestimating time and not starting early led to rushes towards the end while there was a lull of time in the middle
  - Miscellaneous
    - There are risks of aiming too high in v1 where we don't have a well produced product in time to even implement v2.
- **Appreciations:**
  - Ungrouped:
    - I appreciate how patient my teammates are with absences and circumstances because I know that it can be a set back. I also appreciate how organized everyone is and how we went about not taking, GitHub issues, etc.
    - Andrew for all his work on the backend and integration ðŸ™Œ
    - Andrew put in a lot of hard work! Thank you. I wish I knew what was going on with integration and could've helped
    - Huge shout out to all the devs who stepped in for each other and for issues that they weren't assigned to, really kept the team going
    - Andrew and Matteo for being able to help out with despite being very last minute and rushed
    - I appreciate how great we collaborate and work within the team
    - I appreciate everyone who was able to help in a pinch even when it wasn't their designated task
    - I think the CI/CD pipeline is great because it can always check that our functions are implemented correctly.
    - Andrew + Mialyssa + Matteo. Tirelessly worked today to get integration to a working state
    - +1 To the Designers, did an amazing job with the Hi-Fis
    - I appreciate my team for pickings up my slack for this week
- **Puzzles:**
  - Ungrouped
    - Just next steps to work on in V2
    - Scheduling/availability of the week prior to the conflicts actually occuring
    - Integration
    - It is just time consuming while I have to work on the team project, lab and study for the midterm at the same time
    - What is the end goal for each checkpoint
    - How should our time be divided for the next sprint?
    - Why is electron not up to date with the standards of modern Web development? Seems quite archaic.

### Issues voted on, discussion done, and consensus received:
- More communication needed:
	- Have a channel for daily standups where we can track progress, blockers, and scheduling conflicts.
	- When listing blockers in #check-in, also list issues that you faced when developing what you've done so far, so that's a heads up for people working on development in the future.
	- Try to create an environment where people can openly discuss issues without needing nudges to do so.
	- Resolution reached: Have a slackbot ping us daily to send a message with three quick bullet points: "what you worked on, blockers, scheduling conflicts for the next few days"
- Last minute development:
	- Goes in tandem with lack of communication.
	- For the next two weeks, we will have a very aggressive dev timeline because of the time constraints
	- Be more transparent with where you're at, what you're doing, how you need help.
- Integration: 
	- Part of the same bubble as the previous two issues.
	- Same resolution could mitigate these issues as well.
- Resolution: Team leads will announce what the current status of the project during the daily announcements. 
- Team scheduling:
	- Have people schedule five hours a week that they'll be guaranteed to be working on the product, so that teammates and team leads are better updated on people's availability for work.

### Action Items:
- Samvrit: Have a slackbot ping us daily to send a message with three quick bullet points: "what you worked on, blockers, scheduling conflicts for the n

### Overall Takeaways

The feedback provided valuable insights into areas for improvement. These will be invaluable in shaping future sprints and ensuring continued growth of the team's skill sets. Overall, the retrospective served as a valuable opportunity for the team to reflect, setting a good precedent for future projects.
